	I still stand by what I firmly beleive, I admit no wrongdoing and you _______ cant take away my rights of free speech nor can you force me to change my thoughts or ideas.<br>
	Simply having one word does not mean the whole websites intentions are wrong. This website was not made to  target people that are<br>
	that are absoulute _______ and if you simply find the content offensive you can just exit the website. Theres nothing you stopping you from exiting the website.<br>
	I am not forcing you to stay here a read through the terms, and as stated in the terms I am not responsible for any of the contents on the website so it makes no sense<br>
	to give me a punishment and to force me to change the website. I beleive my rights have been violated and I would admit wrongdoing if I had used school resources to develope<br>
	this website but I did not. I was simply doing this as a hobby with a group of friends and don't understand why you want to interfere in my personal live so much<br>
	this website has not caused any harm to, the school, you, or anyone that has visited this place. I hope in the future I am able to continue expressing my thoughts and ideas<br>
	freely like the founding fathers wanted America to be, I do not hope for this Land of the "Free" to become another country like China where freedom of expression<br>
	is nonexistent.<br>
	<br>
	Redirect should be in process<br>
	if it fails go to <a href="https://MyRights.sachsthebased.repl.co">here</a><br>
	<br>
	When people take comedy to hard.<br>
	Haters gonna hate but all I can tell you is cope and move on.
